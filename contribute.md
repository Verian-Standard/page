# Contribute to the Standard for Verifiable AI

The promise of generative AI is hampered by a critical flaw: the high cost of trust. For every hour an AI saves in drafting, professionals often spend an equal or greater amount of time manually verifying its output, especially in high-stakes environments. This challenge, the "Verification-Value Paradox," is what the Verian Standard was created to solve.

Building a truly universal standard requires a community. We are actively seeking contributions from subject matter experts, technologists, and researchers who believe that a verifiable, trustworthy AI is not just possible, but necessary.

## Our Contribution Process

Our goal is to be open and transparent. Technical contributions are managed through our GitHub repository and future Technical Working Groups. Use case and research contributions begin with a conversation with our formation committee.

We believe that by bringing together the brightest minds from industry and academia, we can build the foundational layer of trust for the next generation of AI.
